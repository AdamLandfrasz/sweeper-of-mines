# Minesweeper Javascript Game
### I built this project in about 3 weeks using:
    -Node.js Express server
    -Vanilla Javascript

#### My goal for this project was to recreate the nostalgic feel of the old Windows98 version of the minesweeper, while sharpening my algorithmic skills and I specifically wanted to deploy this project on Heroku to be able to present a fun, addictive game.
